## How to use Fitnetic

The [Fitnetic website](https://www.fitnetic.netlify.app) is a web interface that connects to the Arduino Board through BLE. Open the website on your laptop/phone (Using a phone is recommended as it allows you to use Fitnetic while you go about your day with the phone in your pocket). On start up you will get a screen that looks like this.
